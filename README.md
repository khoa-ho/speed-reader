#### Usability Testing
Summary:

Both readers were having initial trouble adjusting to the speed reader
because of the moving words and how fast the words are moving. After
several practice readings using the additional reading excerpts, both readers
were able to get through more of the reading. As practicing continued,
both readers claimed to start feeling more comfortable with the speed
reader, and reading at the pace. When it was time to take the test I asked
the readers what they were most anxious about, both responded along the
lines of "actually comprehending, while reading that quickly." Lizzy was
ecstatic with her results because she thought she was going to get 0/4 on
her quiz, and on her second quiz she score a three. She said she said she
felt more comfortable with the speed reader wh. Zach, on the other hand,
was not so content with his result 0f 25%, he was so distressed he
requested to do another reading and take another which he scored one point higher on, feeling satisfied he ended his
attempts there.
